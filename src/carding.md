1. Age Verification Requirement
Legal Age: In accordance with state laws, you must be at least 21 years old to purchase recreational cannabis. For medical cannabis, age requirements may vary.
ID Required: All customers must present a valid government-issued photo ID for age verification at the time of purchase.

2. Acceptable Forms of ID
Acceptable forms of identification include:

3. What Happens If You Forget Your ID?
If you do not have a valid ID with you, we cannot complete the sale. Please remember to bring your ID for all visits to our shop.
4. Handling Minors
We do not sell cannabis products to anyone under the legal age. If a customer appears to be under 30, our staff will card them to ensure compliance.
